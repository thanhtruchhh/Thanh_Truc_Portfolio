# My Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, created by customizing the [Personal Portfolio Website](https://github.com/thepranaygupta/thepranaygupta.github.io) repository. I would like to express my gratitude to [@thepranaygupta](https://github.com/thepranaygupta) for creating the original repository, which served as the foundation for my project.

## Purpose

I have used this repository as a starting point to build my personal portfolio website. The purpose of this project is to showcase my work, skills, and experiences in a professional manner.

## Customizations

In the process of creating my personal portfolio, I made the following customizations to the original repository:

- Modified the user interface and layout to better align with my preferences and requirements
- Removed the "change theme" and "carousel" features, as they were not necessary for my portfolio.
