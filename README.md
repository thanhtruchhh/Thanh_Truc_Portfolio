# My Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, created by customizing the [Responsive Portfolio Website](https://github.com/ASouthernCat/responsive-portfolio-website) repository. I would like to express my gratitude to [@ASouthernCat](https://github.com/ASouthernCat) for creating the original repository, which served as the foundation for my project.

## Purpose

I have used this repository as a starting point to build my personal portfolio website. The purpose of this project is to showcase my work, skills, and experiences in a professional manner.

## Customizations

In the process of creating my personal portfolio, I made the following customizations to the original repository:

- Modified the user interface and layout to better align with my preferences and requirements
- Removed the "change theme" feature, as it was not necessary for my portfolio.
